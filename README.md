# 🖼️ AI Image Classifier

This project is a simple yet powerful **AI Image Classifier** built using **Streamlit**, **TensorFlow Keras**, and the **MobileNetV2** model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.

It allows users to upload an image, processes it using deep learning, and returns the top 3 predictions of what the image might be.
